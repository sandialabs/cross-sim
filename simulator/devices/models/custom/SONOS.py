    SUGGESTED ON/OFF RATIO : 1e7 (~0 to 16 uS)

    Three non-idealities are modeled, based on the statistics of experimentally
    measured SONOS device currents from 128K devices. Both effects are time
    dependent. For details, see the paper.
    1) Drift in the expected value of the SONOS current, relative to the value
        at time of programming. By definition, this is not applied if time = 0.
    2) Random variability in the SONOS current around the expected value, due to
        random write errors and device-to-device variations.
    3) Read noise in the SONOS current around the programmed value

    The first effect is shown in Fig. 10(b) of the paper. At each point in time,
    the dependence of the drift vs SONOS state is fit using a 10th degree
    polynomial with 11 coefficients. This is evaluated and added to the target
    currents to get the mean values after drift. The coefficients were extracted
    for measurements taken at t = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 days. For values of t
    between these time steps, the coefficients are interpolated.

    The second effect is shown in Fig. 10(a) of the paper. At each point in
    time, the dependence of the random variation vs SONOS state is fit using a
    saturating exponential function with 2 free parameters (A and B). This
    function is used to scale a 2D matrix of random normal numbers and this is
    added to the SONOS current values, after mean drift is applied. The values
    of A and B were extracted for measurements taken at t = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5
    days. For values of t between these steps, A and B are interpolated.
    If time > 5 days, the polynomial coefficients and A and B will be
    extrapolated, and are not guaranteed to be accurate.

    The third effect is shown in Fig. 11(b) of the paper. The state dependence
    of the variance of read noise is modeled by a saturating exponential
    function similar to device-to-device variability, but with a different pair
    of coefficients: A_noise and B_noise. This function is used to scale a 2D
    matrix of random normal numbers, and this is added to the SONOS current
    values every time an MVM is called. These coefficients do not vary with
    time.
